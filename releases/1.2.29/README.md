## Changes

### UDP gateway stat acknowledgement rate fix

The `ackr` field in the periodic gateway stat report could exceed 100% (e.g. 150%). The stat message itself is a PUSH_DATA and receives a PUSH_ACK from the LNS, but the sent counter (`s_push_sent`) was only incremented for uplink PUSH_DATA frames. The received ACK counter (`s_push_acked`) counted all PUSH_ACKs including those for stat messages, causing the rate to be overstated.

Fixed by incrementing `s_push_sent` when the stat PUSH_DATA is transmitted.

## Flashing

### SD card (no programmer required)

```bash
lsblk   # find device node, e.g. /dev/sdb
sudo /home/remko/ksig/prepare-sdcard.sh /dev/sdX
```

Insert SD card into gateway and power cycle.

### PICkit 4

```bash
IPECMD=/opt/microchip/mplabx/v6.25/mplab_platform/mplab_ipe/ipecmd.sh
$IPECMD -TPPK4 -P32MZ2048EFM144 -F releases/1.2.29/firmware.hex -M
```
